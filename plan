Requirements:
  List of all earshot stations (for validation)
  Error handling for charts which aren't found
  Slightly more advanced date handling. Running into trouble when looking on Monday, stuff getting improperly saved, etc.
  Automated crawling. The database should build itself (whenever I tell it to - start with all of 2013)




API Requests:

Request any single chart:
  Look in DB
    if found -> return
    else -> crawl, add to db, return DB copy.
    Gotta stop serving crawled data. Only serve stuff from the DB for data consistency.

Request any single week:
  Check db for all stations for that week
    if found -> return
    else crawl the ones that are missing, add to DB, and return.

  Views for this will be more complicated. Accordions, maybe? Initial display is list of stations + their number 1s? Click to expand and display full chart

Request any single Artist:
  Check DB for instances of that artist
    if found -> return all of them
    else -> say "not found", give some database stats (x individual charts, x individual artists), offer other searches


Request any single station over any period of time:
  Check DB, generate list of all missing charts, crawl all missing charts, add to db, return
  Provide statistical information: aggregated top 30, Album(s) with most appearances, total albums charted

Request any number of stations over any period of time:
  Same as above, but with more stations

Request any period of time:
  Same as above, but with all stations
